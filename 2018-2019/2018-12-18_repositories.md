## Repositories and Sharing
### What does this look like at Berkeley?
Recommendation: deposit in domain repository, UC repository, or both
### What to look for in a domain repository?
Look at the repository's funding sources, partner institutions, and policies. Data housed in the repository should be discoverable, accessible, clearly licensed, usable, and uniquely identifiable - ideally with a common identifier like a DOI.

[CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org/about/) - new merging of WDS and DSA certifications - 16 requirements for repositories to get seal; so far there are 40 repositories that have seal, including Merritt.
### How to find a domain repository?
- [Register of data repositories](https://www.re3data.org/) 
  - search or browse
  - browsing using visualizations didn't really work for me
  - comprehensive, so may help you find data, but not all listed repositories open for deposit
 - [Open Access Directory - Data Repositories](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Data_repositories)
    - browseable, but not very comprehensive
 - Funding agencies and journal publishers often have lists of approved or recommended repositories
 ### What is the UC repository?
 - [DASH](https://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/dash.html) 
    - run by UC Curation Center (UC3) 
    - data sharing tool that sits on top of [Merritt](https://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/merritt/index.html) (the actual UC repository)
    - helps researchers with curation (using DataCite metadata schema) and assigns DOI
 - UC3 also produces EZID & DMPTool
 - In October there was news that UC3 is partnering with [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/) to build a data ‘publishing and curation service’
 - UC Data Network (UCDN) - Data storage is expensive; campuses contribute capital
 ### Why share data?
 - **Benefits to author:** can boost your citations and number of publications; increases your exposure; may help you find collaborators; helps you comply with funding or publisher mandates
 - **Benefits to other researchers:** can reproduce or verify research; can ask new questions and advance research; helps avoid duplication of experiments
- **Benefits to society:** helps make publicly-funded research more available to public; greater transparency; avoiding duplication of experiments saves money
### Data sharing considerations
- appropriate metadata standards - discipline dependent; *what is our role as librarians?* 
- documentation - via a readme.txt file - includes context; methodology; file structure / organization; quality assurance; conditions of access and use; variable names and descriptions; definitions; missing values; etc 
- file formats - non-proprietary
