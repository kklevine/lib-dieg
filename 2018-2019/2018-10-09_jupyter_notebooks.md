# Jupyter Notebooks for Data Initiatives Expertise Group

## Objectives: 
* Understand how Jupyter Notebooks are used in academic research
* Understand why they're so important for data science

## What are Jupyter Notebooks? 
* Part of Project Jupyter, a spinoff of iPython (which was developed by Berkeley's own Fernando PÃ©rez)
* Compatible with **Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon, **R**, and now dozens more programming languages
* Allows ["literate programming"](https://unidata.github.io/online-python-training/introduction.html)
* Open source alternative to Mathematica Notebook
  * Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Romer [prefers Jupyter Notebook](https://paulromer.net/jupyter-mathematica-and-the-future-of-the-research-paper/) for sharing his research data


## How are Jupyter notebooks used?
* Notebooks are usually hosted on GitHub
* Once a user downloads the Notebook, they can execute and modify the code within the Jupyter environment.
* It's becoming a platform for publishing scientific papers, such as the [LIGO Gravitational Waves observation](https://www.gw-openscience.org/tutorials/)
* The [Python API for SAS](https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/overview.html) uses Project Jupyter (which is why Hilary was interested, Haas is big on SAS)
* Jupyter Notebooks are a front-end interface for cloud platforms like Amazon SageMaker Notebooks, Google Colaboratory, and Microsoft Azure Notebook
