# APIs for DIEG
_With thanks to D-LAB's [Python Data from the Web](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-data-from-web)_

## Objectives
* Gentle introduction to APIs
* Play with NY Times API

## What is an API?

* Application Programming Interface

* Interface between an application (e.g., Facebook) and some programming (e.g., your code)

## Why use APIs?

* It's how the Application would like you to use their data.
* So it's legal and structured.
* _But_ that doesn't mean it's complete or necessarily reproducible (often opaque sampling).

## Web APIs

* Most adhere to a particular style known as Reperesentational State Transfer or REST

* You use _RESTful APIs_ all the time

	* e.g., https://www.google.com/#q=search1+search2

* URLs: Uniform Resource Location

* HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol

* HTTP Methods:
	* * GET: requests a representation of a data resource corresponding to a particular URL
	* * Surfing the Web = Making a bunch of GET Requests
	* * Response online is often a file (HTML, PHP) that is interpreted and displayed by the browser
	* * Many APIs make it possible to request specific pieces of information (e.g., byline, date published)
	* * Usually as raw text in a CSV, JSON, or other file format 
	* * Other HTTP Methods: HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE

## Using APIs
* You can use R, Python, or other programming languages
* Let's look at [NY Times Developer](https://developer.nytimes.com/)
1. You need an API Key (often free, sometimes paid)
	* * Usually have rate limits
	* * NYT API = 10 calls per second and 10,000 calls per day
2. Choose an API: [Article Search API](https://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json)
3. Construct API GET Request
	* * Look for API documentation
	* * Let's try the [NY Times Article Search API](https://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json)

* For more NY Times API practice (in Python) try [the D-Lab notebook](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-data-from-web/blob/master/1_APIs/3_api_workbook.ipynb)

* More scholarly (citation, text) APIs of note on the [Text Mining guide](http://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/text-mining)
