#Data Initiatives Expertise Group- Institutional Review Board (IRB) Teach-In

## Institutional Review Board:

* A committee that applies research ethics by reviewing methods proposed to do research in an ethical manor. The committee serves to approve, monitor and review both behavioral (mostly us) and biomedical research that involves humans

## Why do you need IRB review? 
* Research **is not** and **has not** always been conducted ethically
* Experiments conducted by [Nazi Physicians in WWII] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation) 
* The [Tuskegee Syphilis Study] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment)
* The [Stanford Prison Experiments] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment)
* As a result of these many unethical and extremely harmful research studies, the [National Research Act] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Research_Act) was created along with the development of the [Belmont Report] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Report)



## Major Components to Think About
* Literature Review
* Background and need for research
* Methodology
* Data security, storage, preservation
* Future plans
* Risk assessment of populations
	*Is informed consent required?
	*Are you using any vulnerable populations?
		*This includes, students, pregnant women, elderly, mentally 			impaired individuals and prisoners

## Tricks for IRB at Berkeley
* Librarians are not considered PIs unless you are granted exceptional status to do so
* the UL serves as the PI
* if you donâ€™t intend to publish it, you may not need an IRB
* the larger the project the more time it will take
* a few rounds of revisions are usually required before approval is granted
*ask for help from others who have completed it
